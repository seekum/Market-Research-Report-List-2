<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absolute Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Shaft</li><li>Hollow Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absolute encoders are used to measure the exact position of a rotating shaft. There are two main types of absolute encoders based on their shaft design: solid shaft and hollow shaft. Solid shaft encoders are directly mounted onto the shaft of a motor or machine, while hollow shaft encoders have a hollow opening that allows the shaft of the machine to pass through the encoder. Both types offer precise position feedback for industrial applications, but the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the system.</p></p>
