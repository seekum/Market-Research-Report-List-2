<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Strip Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Sided</li><li>Double-Slided</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicon strip detectors are widely used in particle physics experiments due to their high sensitivity and precision. There are two main types of silicon strip detectors in the market: single-sided and double-sided. Single-sided detectors have one layer of silicon strips, providing only one-dimensional position information. On the other hand, double-sided detectors have silicon strips on both sides, allowing for two-dimensional position information. Double-sided detectors offer higher resolution and efficiency compared to single-sided detectors, making them suitable for more complex experiments.</p></p>
