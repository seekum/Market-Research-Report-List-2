<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Tag/Label Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID tags can be classified into two main types: Active and Passive. Active RFID tags have their own power source and can transmit data over longer distances, usually up to 100 meters. They are ideal for tracking high-value items that move over large areas. On the other hand, Passive RFID tags do not have a power source and rely on the power from the RFID reader to transmit data. They are typically used for tracking inventory and are more cost-effective for large-scale deployment.</p></p>
