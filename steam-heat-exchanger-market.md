<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Heat Exchanger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Heating Equipment</li><li>Indirect Heating Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steam heat exchangers are divided into two main types based on their heating methods: direct heating equipment and indirect heating equipment. Direct heating equipment directly heats the process fluid by bringing it in direct contact with steam, while indirect heating equipment transfers heat through a heat transfer surface, separating the process fluid from the steam. Direct heating equipment is more energy-efficient and faster in heating up the process fluid, while indirect heating equipment provides better control over the temperature and is safer for heat-sensitive materials.</p></p>
