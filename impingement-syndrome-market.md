Structural Impingement refers to physical abnormalities in the joints or surrounding tissues that lead to compression of structures within the joint, causing pain and limited range of motion. On the other hand, Functional Impingement occurs when improper movement patterns or muscle imbalances result in impingement symptoms without any structural abnormalities. Both types of Impingement Syndrome can cause pain, inflammation, and decreased function in the affected joint.</p></p>
