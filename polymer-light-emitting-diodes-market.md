<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Light Emitting Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Matrix</li><li>Active Matrix</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer Light Emitting Diodes (PLEDs) are categorized into two main types in the market: Passive Matrix and Active Matrix. Passive Matrix PLEDs use a simple addressing scheme where rows and columns are selectively activated to produce light, making them cost-effective but with limited resolution. On the other hand, Active Matrix PLEDs use thin film transistors to control individual pixels, offering higher resolution and faster response times, but at a higher cost. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on their specific characteristics.</p></p>
