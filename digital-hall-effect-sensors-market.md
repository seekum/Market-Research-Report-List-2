<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Hall Effect Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Unipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital Hall Effect Sensors are categorized into two main types - Bipolar and Unipolar. Bipolar sensors detect both positive and negative magnetic fields, making them ideal for applications where both north and south poles need to be detected. Unipolar sensors, on the other hand, only detect one type of magnetic field, typically the south pole. This makes them a cost-effective option for applications that only require detection of a specific magnetic field polarity. Both types of sensors offer reliable and accurate sensing capabilities for a wide range of industrial and automotive applications.</p></p>
