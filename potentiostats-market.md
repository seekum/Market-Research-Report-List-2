<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Potentiostats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipotentiostat</li><li>Polypotentiostat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Potentiostats are devices used in electrochemistry to control the voltage between a working electrode and a reference electrode, while measuring the resulting current. Bipotentiostats are designed to control the voltage between two working electrodes simultaneously, allowing for comparison experiments. Polypotentiostats, on the other hand, can control the voltage between multiple working electrodes at once, making them ideal for high-throughput testing or experiments involving multiple samples. Both types of potentiostats offer expanded capabilities for researchers in the field of electrochemistry.</p></p>
