<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sintered Diamond Saw Blades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Pressed Sintered</li><li>Cold Press Sintered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sintered diamond saw blades are categorized into two types based on the manufacturing process - hot pressed sintered and cold press sintered. Hot pressed sintered blades are made by heating the diamond mixture to high temperatures and pressure, resulting in a durable and long-lasting blade. On the other hand, cold press sintered blades are produced at lower temperatures and pressure, making them more cost-effective but less durable compared to hot pressed blades. Both types have their own advantages and are used for different applications in the construction industry.</p></p>
